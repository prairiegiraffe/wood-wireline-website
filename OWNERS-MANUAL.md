## 📧 Why Am I Not Getting Emails?

**The most common reason you're not receiving form submission emails is because email notifications are turned off for your account.**

### How to Turn On Email Notifications

1. Log into the admin dashboard (see above)
2. Click **Settings** in the top navigation bar
3. Scroll down to **Email Notifications** section
4. Under "Notify me about", select one of the following options:
   - **None** - You won't receive any emails (this is probably why you're not getting them!)
   - **Contact forms only** - Only get emails when someone submits a contact form
   - **Job applications only** - Only get emails when someone submits a job application
   - **All form submissions** - Get emails for both contact forms and job applications
5. Click **Save Notification Preferences**

**Note:** Emails are sent to the email address associated with your account. Check your spam/junk folder if you still don't see them.
